# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Risk Analytics in Banking

## Introduction

This analysis focuses on understanding patterns in loan application data to minimize the risk of lending to customers. The dataset includes information about clients at the time of loan application, their previous loan data, and a data dictionary. The business objective is to identify patterns indicating clients' difficulty in paying installments, allowing the company to make informed decisions and mitigate risks.

## Problem Statement

Loan providers face challenges in lending to clients with insufficient credit history, leading to potential defaults. The company needs to identify key variables influencing loan default and use this knowledge for risk assessment. The dataset includes information on approved, cancelled, refused, and unused loan applications, helping us analyze factors contributing to payment difficulties.

## Analysis Approach

1. **Handling Missing Data:**
   - Identify missing data in columns.
   - Use appropriate methods (removal or replacement) based on the nature and impact of missing values.

2. **Outlier Detection:**
   - Identify outliers in the dataset.
   - Understand why they are outliers.
   - No need to remove outliers for this exercise.

3. **Data Imbalance Analysis:**
   - Identify data imbalance in the target variable (clients with payment difficulties and others).
   - Find the ratio of data imbalance.
   - Use a mix of univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the impact of data imbalance.

4. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Find the top 10 correlations for clients with payment difficulties and others.
   - Segment the data frame with respect to the target variable.
   - Identify insights from correlations for risk assessment.

## Analysis Steps (in Python)

### 1. Handling Missing Data

```python
# Identify missing data
missing_data = df.isnull().sum()

# Handle missing data (example: replace with mean or drop columns)
df['column_name'].fillna(df['column_name'].mean(), inplace=True)
```

### 2. Outlier Detection

```python
# Identify outliers (example using box plot)
import seaborn as sns
sns.boxplot(x=df['numeric_column'])
```

### 3. Data Imbalance Analysis

```python
# Identify data imbalance
imbalance_ratio = len(df[df['target_variable'] == 1]) / len(df[df['target_variable'] == 0])

# Use various plots for imbalance analysis
# Example: bar plot, pie chart, etc.
```

### 4. Correlation Analysis

```python
# Segment data by target variable
df_difficulties = df[df['target_variable'] == 1]
df_others = df[df['target_variable'] == 0]

# Find top correlations for each segment
correlation_difficulties = df_difficulties.corr().abs().unstack().sort_values(ascending=False)
correlation_others = df_others.corr().abs().unstack().sort_values(ascending=False)
```

## Visualizations and Insights

- Include visualizations for missing data, outliers, and data imbalance.
- Summarize important results in business terms.
- Visualize top correlations and provide insights into variables influencing payment difficulties.

## Conclusion

This analysis aims to provide actionable insights for risk assessment in loan applications. The presented approach covers missing data handling, outlier detection, data imbalance analysis, and correlation analysis. Visualizations and business-oriented interpretations enhance the understanding of key factors influencing loan default.
